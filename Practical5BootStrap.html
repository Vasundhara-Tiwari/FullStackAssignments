        <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web
            development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms,
            buttons, navigation, and other interface components.ootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was
            developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to encourage consistency across internal
            tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, which led to inconsistencies
            and a high maintenance burden. According to Twitter developer Mark Otto:

            A super small group of developers and I got together to design and build a new internal tool and saw an
            opportunity to do something more. Through that process, we saw ourselves build something much more
            substantial than another internal tool. Months later, we ended up with an early version of Bootstrap as a
            way to document and share common design patterns and assets within the company.
