        <p>JavaScript is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is
            high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing,
            prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

            Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of
            websites use it client-side for web page behavior,often incorporating third-party libraries. Most
            web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.

            As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming
            styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
            standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
